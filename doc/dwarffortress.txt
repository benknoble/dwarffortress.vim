INTRODUCTION                                               *dwarffortress-intro*

  dwarffortress.vim is a plugin designed to help edit Dwarf Fortress raw
  files. It provides syntax highlighting and snippets to make modding Dwarf
  Fortress easier.

SETTINGS                                          *dwarffortress-configuration*

  There are a few knobs you can turn. Defaults are shown.

                                                         *g:dwarffortress-guess*
  `let g:dwarffortress_guess=1`

  Whether or not to inspect the contents of .txt files to determine if they
  are raw files.

  To be specific, the plugin checks if the first line of the
  file matches its filename, and whether the first few lines contains strings
  known to indicate Dwarf Fortress data files. This could cause slowdowns if
  you're looking at, say, large log files.


                                                        *g:dwarffortress-always*
  `let g:dwarffortress_always=0`

  Whether to assume ALL .txt files are dwarf fortress raws.
  Note: This is probably a bad idea.




this one goes out to those poor souls pathologically addicted to terrible interfaces
